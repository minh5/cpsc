Given that older folks may be less likely to self report, or if they wanted to self report, they may not be tech-savvy enough to use with a web interface.

    "This is actually preplexing, so I decided to investigate further by analyzing the complaints filed for the \"Footwear\" category. To do this, I created a Word2Vec model that uses a convolution neural network for text analysis. This process maps a word and the linguistic context it is in to be able to calculate similarity between words. The purpose of this is to find words that related to each other. Rather than doing a simple cross tab of product categories, I can ingest the complaints and map out their relationship.  For instance, using the complaints that resulted in bodily harm, I found that footwear was associated with pain and walking. It seems that there is injuries related to Sketcher sneakers specifically since it was the only brand that showed up enough to be included in the model's dictionary. In fact, there was a [lawsuit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/05/skechers-will-pay-40-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-deceived) regarding Sketchers and their toning shoes"

    " Although, while it is label to have no injury, it does not necessarily mean that we can't take precaution. What I did was take the same approach as the previous model, I subsetted the data to only complaints that had \"no injury\" and ran a model to examine words used. From the analysis, we see that the word `to`, `was`, and `it` were the top three words. At first glance, it may seem that these words are meaningless, however if we examine words that are similar to it, we can start seeing a connection.\n",
    " \n",
    " For instance, the word most closely related to \"to\" was \"unable\" and \"trying\", which conveys a sense of urgency in attempting to turn something on or off. Examining the words \"unable,\" I was able to see it was related to words such as \"attempted\" and \"disconnect.\" Further investigation lead me to find it was dealing with a switch or a plug, possibly dealing with an electrical item.\n",
    " \n",
    " A similar picture is painted when trying to examine the word \"was.\" The words that felt out of place was \"emitting\", \"extinguish,\" and \"smelled.\" It is not surprise that after a few investigations of these words, that words like \"sparks\" and \"smoke\" started popping up more. This leads me to believe that these complaints have something to do with encounters closely related to fire. \n",

    "This shows that incidents where there are actually injuries and medical attention was given was that in footwear, which was weird. To explore this, I created a Word2Vec model that maps out how certain words relate to each other. To train the model, I used the comments that were made from the API. This will train a model and help us identify words that are similar. For instance, if you type in foot, you will get `left` and `right` as these words are most closely related to the word `foot`. However after some digging around, I found out that the word \"walking\" was associated with \"painful\". I have some reason to believe that there are orthopedic injuries associated with shoes and people have been experience pain while walking with Sketchers that were supposed to tone up their bodies and having some instability or balance issues."
