    "This notebook serves as a reporting tool for the CPSC. In this notebook, I laid out the questions CPSC is interested in learning from their SaferProduct API. The format will be that there are a few questions presented and each question will have a `findings` section where there is a quick summary of the findings while in Section 4, there will be further information on how on the findings were conducted."

    "Given that the API was down during this time of the reporting, I obtained data from Ana Carolina Areias via Dropbox link. Here I cleaned up the pure JSON format and converted it into a dataframe (the cleaning code can be found in the `exploratory.ipynb` in the `/notebook` directory. After that I saved the data using pickle where I can easily load it up for analysis.\n",

    "The questions answered here are the result of a conversation between DKDC and the CPSC regarding their priorities and what information is available from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaways from this analysis is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * From the self-reported statistics of people who reported their injury to the API, it appears that there is a skew against people who are older. The data shows that people who are reporting are 40-60 years old.\n",
    "  * An overwhelming amount of reports did not involve bodily harm or require medical attention; much of the reports were just incident reports with a particular product\n",
    "  * Out of the reports that resulted in some harm, the most reported product was in the footwear category regarding some harm and discomfort with walking with the Sketchers Tone-Ups shoes\n",
    "  * Although not conclusive, but from the reports, there appears to be come indication that there are a lot of fire-related incidents from a cursory examination of the most popular words"

    "This is actually preplexing, so I decided to investigate further by analyzing the complaints filed for the \"Footwear\" category. To do this, I created a Word2Vec model that uses a convolution neural network for text analysis. This process maps a word and the linguistic context it is in to be able to calculate similarity between words. The purpose of this is to find words that related to each other. Rather than doing a simple cross tab of product categories, I can ingest the complaints and map out their relationship.  For instance, using the complaints that resulted in bodily harm, I found that footwear was associated with pain and walking. It seems that there is injuries related to Sketcher sneakers specifically since it was the only brand that showed up enough to be included in the model's dictionary. In fact, there was a [lawsuit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/05/skechers-will-pay-40-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-deceived) regarding Sketchers and their toning shoes"

    " Although, while it is label to have no injury, it does not necessarily mean that we can't take precaution. What I did was take the same approach as the previous model, I subsetted the data to only complaints that had \"no injury\" and ran a model to examine words used. From the analysis, we see that the word `to`, `was`, and `it` were the top three words. At first glance, it may seem that these words are meaningless, however if we examine words that are similar to it, we can start seeing a connection.\n",
    " \n",
    " For instance, the word most closely related to \"to\" was \"unable\" and \"trying\", which conveys a sense of urgency in attempting to turn something on or off. Examining the words \"unable,\" I was able to see it was related to words such as \"attempted\" and \"disconnect.\" Further investigation lead me to find it was dealing with a switch or a plug, possibly dealing with an electrical item.\n",
    " \n",
    " A similar picture is painted when trying to examine the word \"was.\" The words that felt out of place was \"emitting\", \"extinguish,\" and \"smelled.\" It is not surprise that after a few investigations of these words, that words like \"sparks\" and \"smoke\" started popping up more. This leads me to believe that these complaints have something to do with encounters closely related to fire. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This is meant to serve as a starting point on examining the API data. The main findings were that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * From the self-reported statistics of people who reported their injury to the API, it appears that there is a skew against people who are older. The data shows that people who are reporting are 40-60 years old.\n",
    "  * An overwhelming amount of reports did not involve bodily harm or require medical attention; much of the reports were just incident reports with a particular product\n",
    "  * Out of the reports that resulted in some harm, the most reported product was in the footwear category regarding some harm and discomfort with walking with the Sketchers Tone-Ups shoes\n",
    "  * Although not conclusive, but from the reports, there appears to be come indication that there are a lot of fire-related incidents from a cursory examination of the most popular words\n",
    "  \n",
    "While text analysis is helpful, it is often not sufficient. What would really help the analysis process would be include more information from the user. The following information would be helpful to collect to make conduct more actionable insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ethnicity/Race\n",
    "* Self Reported Income\n",
    "* Geographic information\n",
    "   * Region (Mid Atlantic, New England, etc)\n",
    "   * Closest Metropolitan Area\n",
    "   * State\n",
    "   * City\n",
    "* Geolocation of IP address \n",
    "   * coordinates can be \"jittered\" to conserve anonymity\n",
    "   \n",
    "A great next step would be a deeper text analysis on shoes. It may be possible to train a neural network to consider smaller batches of words so we can capture the context better. Other steps that I would do if I had more time would be to find a way to fix up unicode issues with some of the complaints (there were special characters that prevented some of the complaints to be converted into strings). I would also look further into the category that had the most overall complaints: \"Electric Ranges and Stoves\" and see what the complaints were.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could implement these challenges, there is no doubt we could gain some valuable insights on products that are harming Americans. This report serves as the first step. I would like to thank CPSC for this data set and DKDC for the opportunity to conduct this analysis."

    "This shows that incidents where there are actually injuries and medical attention was given was that in footwear, which was weird. To explore this, I created a Word2Vec model that maps out how certain words relate to each other. To train the model, I used the comments that were made from the API. This will train a model and help us identify words that are similar. For instance, if you type in foot, you will get `left` and `right` as these words are most closely related to the word `foot`. However after some digging around, I found out that the word \"walking\" was associated with \"painful\". I have some reason to believe that there are orthopedic injuries associated with shoes and people have been experience pain while walking with Sketchers that were supposed to tone up their bodies and having some instability or balance issues."
