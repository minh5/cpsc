       " u'   I had recently purchased thesketcher shape-up  shoes before I left on vaction and  worn them  a few time to get use to the shoe.  There were comericals on TV show the benefit of the shoes.  They were comfortable shoes. The comerical show you can wear these sketchers shape -up shoe on any terrian up mountian,  brick and cobble stone street as well as sidewalks. They are shoe to help tone your muscle.  My reason for buying the shoes was comfort walking shoe. \\r\\n     I purchsed the sketcher shape-up shoes  on 9/23/2010 and found a coupon when I got home for a discount returned the shoe on 9/24/2010 for my discount.  Then I started wear the shape up shoes on 9/24/2010.   I wore the shoes everyday started with a hour and increase the time daily.   It was on the mid morning the third  of our cruise 10/02/2010. we went ashore  to tour the town.  I probably had the shoe on for about four hour when the fall accured.  I was coming out of store and turn down this street to do some shopping.  I probably walk about 100 step down the street.  Then I step on the cobble stone  about the ten step in.  The shoe had no balance on the cobble stone street,  the shoes cause me to lose balance cause me to fall face first to the ground.  Not realize the danger of the shoe due to the fact it was same type of street in the comerical on TV.  One I loss balance there was on way to recover but fall to the ground cause injury to me.  ( The shoe are dangerous once your get off balance you can not correct it.  So the person fall to the ground).  My head. leg and arm,  elbow were hit in the processs cause great pain.  The greatest pain being the arm.  The fire departament was called and they transported me to the hospital, since were we did not live there nor had a vehicle to drive. \\r\\n  Once at the hosptial the arm was sworn so when the x ray were perform the fracture to the elbow was not seen.  We had a cruse to catch  by 4:00 pm and I was not  mising the boat to leave and be stranded thousand of miles from home.  So I had to deal with  pain till got home.  I could not use left arm at all.  Trying to go to the bathroom, showering, getting dress, and brushing my long hair,  my husband had to help these task.    These sketchers shape- up shoes  ruin my crusie  and could not really enjoy due to the pain I was in.  Once I returned back from our crusie I went to see a othrpedic  doctor.  He took several xray  of the arm and elbow and discover the fracture to the elbow.   There is no treatment, for a fractue elbow but not use the arm for 6 weeks to heal.  I return to work to save my job, and had to deal with the pain.  I work with one arm at my job.  \\r\\n  After several vist with the doctor and 6 week of physical therepy.  I still have arm that that I can not extend the full length.  And is still not straigth.   To this day I wear a orthopedic dyno brace to try and striaghten  the arm.   I still do not have the strength I use to have in the arm as well to it is not fixed.  These shoe sketchers shape -up  need to be recalled and save the government and insurance company who paying out unkown amounts of money, because of the injury these shoes are causing.    My medical bills are over serveral thousands  between what  I have paid me and my health insurance company.   When I see someone buying the shoes I tell them story.    Someone told me about this web site and I want to tell my story before  more people get injuryed and or possible die from  a injury caused by these shoes sketchers shape-up.\\r\\n    The avertizing of the st ',\n",

She had developed a stress fractuer in her foot. As a result she had to wear a walking boot for 8 weeks and also had to have a bone scan and a foot x-ray. During this time she was under orthopedic car. She is a nurse  and is always on her feet. She went and spoke with the retailer and they had agreed to offer a refund. She has not spoken to the manufacture as of yet. She woke up one morning and couldnt put any weight on her feet. She decided to recieve medical care in March of 2010. She feels that it was imperative to convey what happened to while using this product. ',\n",
       " u\"I was leaving a friend's house and stepped on the doorstep while wearing the skecher shape up shoes and fell causing me to break my left ankle in 2 places and hurt a ligament in my foot.  I had to have surgery  with a plate and screws being placed in my ankle and missed 3 months of work.  I feel the shoes are responsible for the accident and need to be taken off the market.  My ankle  still hurts and probably will never be the same.  Please consider  taking the shoes off the market before more people are hurt.   I am back at work only because I cannot afford to take any more time off.  My ankle still pains me  with every step I take.\",\n",
       " u\" In early February I purchased a pair of Skecher's tone-ups and noticed after wearing them for about three weeks that the velcro straps didnot stay fastened. I was out of town and decided upon my return I was going to take them back to the store I purchased them from and inquire if anything could be done about the straps. Three days ago I fell, twisted my ankle and while attempting to brace myself for the fall  I ended up braking my left wrist. The velcro came loose and I tumbled while simply stepping off a curb. I am a 67 yr old health educator, yoga instructor/therapist and director of a wellness/fitness company. I am in excellent health, with no prior disorders that would result in this mishap. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

That evening the ball of my left foot began feeling bruised, tender and started swelling. I rested with no exercise for 4 days, but continued to attempt normal walking. The pain increased so much I could not bare weight on the left foot. The area remained swollen, more tender and bruised with a knot feeling in the middle. I went to Ortho Dr. on 3-15-11 diagnosed with possible stress fracture - Dr. stated so much trauma and swelling hard to see. Diagnosed with strained tendons & ligamentsand symptoms of stress fracture. I was put in a boot and instructed to continue taking Alieve and ice twice a day and elevate left foot as much as possible. I returned to Dr. on 3-18-11 with pain even worse (unbearable) and swelling has not subsided at all. He orderd MRI of left foot - awaiting results. Put me on Lortab for pain, instructed remain in boot, and use crutches and elevate foot. I have had to be off work 1 week because of this.\\r\\nAfter research and talking to others, it seems the \"tone\" shoes cause ortho injuries and are NOT safe to wear because they  cause one to walk in a different manner in attempt to \"tone\". Even the commercials show people working out in these shoes. I feel these shoes are NOT safe to wear and need to removed from the market for reassessment for safety. The injuries are painful and costly.',\n",
       " u'I received a pair of Skechers Shape-ups as a gift and began to wear them according to instructions.  Within two weeks I have developed severe debilitating knee and hip pain and I believe it is due to these shoes.  At first, they felt good - like they were helping to align my posture.  I didn\\'t really feel any of the purported \"work out\" benefit, but they seemed comfortable and I continued to increase the amount of time I was walking in them.  Now I have excruciating bilateral knee pain and need to have an MRI on both legs to determine the source of injury.  I can barely walk.  I also started having hip pain - deep joint pain that made me nauseous it was so intense.  Since I stopped wearing the shoes, the hip pain has subsided, but the knee pain continues and is beyond anything I have ever experienced in intensity.  I am seriously concerned that I have permanently injured my knees.  I\\'m not sure if the shoes change your alignment somehow or exactly where the problem is.  One thing I experienced is that is nearly impossible to turn your foot on certain surfaces causing one to wrench the knee to the side, but they also change your gait.  Nothing else in my life has changed - I have tried no other new shoes, no change in work or recreational habits, no falls or stumbles....these shoes are the only thing that can be causing this.  I wish I could say that my knee pain improved after I stopped wearing them, but so far it has not.  It is intense enough that 800 mg of ibuprofen is not putting a dent in it.  I feel  I should have researched these more thoroughly before trying these shoes, but I guess I assumed they would be good for me.  It never occurred to me that a shoe could cause this sort of injury.  I don\\'t think anyone should be wearing them and if they do try them, they should be made aware of potential injury and warned to discontinue use at the first sign of discomfort.  I wish I had know.

I cracked my right ankle and then fell on my left knee which broke the inside of my left tibia.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe it was because of these toning shoes that I fell.

       " u'On March 22, 2011 I went to Footlocker to purchase a new pair of shoes.  I was looking for good walking shoes as I am on my feet all day at work and do a lot of walking.  They recommended Reebok Easytone athletic shoes.  I tried them on and they felt comfortable on the bottom of my feet.  I purchased these shoes and went home.  I read the information supplied in the booklet they included in the box which explained that the toning part was an \"instability cushion\" located in the bottom of the shoes that would tone portions of the calf, upper thigh, and buttocks muscles.  I wore the shoes at work on 3/23 and 3/24.  At the end of my shift on 3/24 I noticed a lot of pain and swelling in the inside of my left ankle.  I did not wear the shoes again.  On 3/25 I could not put any weight on my left ankle and notified my doctor.  During my visit we xrayed my foot and nothing was broken.  I showed him the shoes I had worn and he stated that due to the constant instability caused by the \"instability cushion\" I had aggravated the tendon and possibly tore ligaments in my ankle.  I was given inflammatory medication and my ankle is wrapped in an ace bandage.  I am unable to work until this heals which I am told could take up to 4-6 weeks.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI feel that these Reebok Easytone shoes are unsafe for consumers and should not be sold.  The \"instability cushion\" causes harm to the ankle just by walking in the shoes.  There is no mention in the booklet included with the shoes about the stress placed on the ankle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease contact me if you have any questions',\n",

       " u\"I purchased a pair of  skechers shape ups toning shoes to help me stay in shape over the cold winter day's by taking walks on nice days and use them to run errands like I normally do and to walk around the house doing house work. I purchased my first pair in in the begining of 2010 a pair of all white leather skechers shape up they were great in the begining...I would use them to walk around the track and go to the gym. They felt weird to balance on but I got used to it...after a couple of months of useing them I started to get pain in my hips and legs and pelvic bone I thought it was working out my legs and that's why I was feeling these ache's and pain's so I continued useing them being I spent over $100 for them and thought I'd get used to them but I didn't. I continued to feel the pain get worst so I stopped useing them and felt ok from time to time I thought they were too high and awkward and uncomfortable to wear once they broke in so I stopped wearing them in November of 2010 and came across the new skechers shape up toning sneakers at Models in December of 2010 and tried on a pair and loved how they felt they were flatter then the old shape-ups and again felt good at first continued to wear them for a couple of month's they also were hard to balance on they had a ball heal to balance on when you walked which felt like your feet wobbled if you didn't balace them right I started getting a pinch in my lower back and again started getting pain in my hips and extreme pain in my feet when I woke up one morning after a day of taking a long walk with the family at a park...I woke up to severe pain in my left foot when I tried to step out of bed. I called the orthopedic and went in for a check up she said lets do an ex-ray and it turned out I have fractured my left foot and edema from wearing the skechers sneakers. she said they are not a good sneaker to wear and she does not like this kind of sneaker for her patients to wear they cause foot fractures and other foot problems to stop wearing them asap. I now have to wear a boot until we see if my foot heals I have extreme pain now in both my feet I have to keep my feet elevated and if I walk... I have walk on the heel of my feet for a couple of minutes which is so uncomfortable and painful If I try to fully walk on my feet it feels like my toe's are going to shatter from my weight on them. I try to take it easy which is not easy being a mom of two school age children and running a busy household. I wish they had a waring label on them telling you what the long run would be wearing these shape-up sneakers and not advertise see better results the longer you wear them!

       " u'i purchased skechers shape up shoes from famous footwear on April 30, 2010.  I read the pamplet and watched the instructional dvd. I gradually wore the shoes over the next 11 days.  On Mat 11, 2010 while walking across the street in front of my house to go to my car,  my left foot touched down on a slightly uneven part of the blacktop.  The shoes are 3 inches high so when my right foot rolled OUTWARD the fall caused my ankle to break.  I was left standing in the street on one leg.  While trying to keep my balance and not fall completely flat on my face in the middle of the street, my left foot ROCKED FORWARD (that is what the shoes is designed to do) and then my whole leg twisted inward and crumpled underneith me.  No big suprise here, but my left ankle broke also.  Did I mention that it also tore my left achilles tendon and cause tendonapathy??  Yup. I was left laying in the middle of the street with two broken ankle right infront of my house.  Dangerous Shoes!!  There should be a warning lable!!',\n",

I made appointment with a podiatrist and received injection of cortizone. My doctor advised me not stop wearing the Skechers Shape Up shoes however the pain in my right heel never got any better and around November my doctor ordered a bone scan and found that I had a stress fracture to my right heel.  I am still having treatment to my foot.  A special foot boot or removable cast was ordered and I had to use a knee wheel and wheel chair for about two months.

       " u\"I bought a pair of Sketcher's Shape Ups about 1 year ago and recently, I've experienced lower back pain.  During my walking exercises, about 40 minutes into the exercise, I get extreme pain from my left hip and left knee.  This has been going on since approximately February 1, 2011.  When I returned from vacation, I went to the doctor about my back pain.  I informed my doctor of my hip and knee pain as well.  During the examination, I laid flat on the table, the doctor raised my left leg up into the air and I came off the table in extreme pain in my left femur. I was in tears.  The doctor, after the complete examination diagnosed my left side was out of alignment and she recommended physical therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter my doctor's appointment, I picked up my adult son at the airport for a visit with me. He noticed my walking and asked me if my ankles always rolled inward?  I wasn't aware of this defect.  No one else ever told me anything.  So, I took off my Sketchers and put on my old tennis shoes with orthotics in them and walked around, my son said, my gait was normal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen wearing Sketchers I always felt I was bouncing up and down while I walked.  At first, I thought they were very comfortable to wear.  I never realized how they affected my gait until my son informeed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going back to my doctor to request an MRI to be done on my hip and knee for possible stress fractures.  I read about these shoes on the Internet this past weekend.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI firmly believe these shoes are dangerous to ones'  gait and health.\",\n",
       " u'I was at a restaurant and was sitting on a stool, when I went to leave I stepped down and my ankle rolled in I tried to correct myself and then my ankle rolled out and i proceeded to fall to the floor. I was taken to the ER where they determined I had suffered a dislocated and broken ankle in at least 4 places. I then had surgery which resulted in 2 plates and 9 screws inserted into my ankle which are permanent. I think if the shoes had more stability on the heel the injury would not have been as severe.

       " u'I purchased the Sketchers Shape Up shoes in March 2010. The first time I wore them out of the house, I was walking on the sidewalk at 3rd Street in Los Angeles, heading toward The Grove, when I stepped on an uneven sidewalk and fell. The sidewalk squares were only about 1 inch off but I stepped down with my left foot, my left ankle twisted and I could not catch my balance and fell. I tried to catch my fall and put out my right arm. I tried to get up and could only walk a few steps to the bus bench and called my husband to come get me. We went to the hosptial, they exrayed my left ankle and told me it was broken. A week later I got a cast, which I had on for about 6 weeks. The residual effect has been my right arm and shoulder. I jammed them during the fall and as a result, I had a frozen shoulder until about 2 months ago. I went through numerous tests, physical therapy , chiropatric and massage therapies as well. It is now, at 1 yr later, about 95% healed but still some residual effects. I have not worn those shoes since.',\n",
       " u\"We\\u2019re contacting your office about a product safety issue related to the Old Navy line of \\u201cSparkle Flip Flops,\\u201d which we recently purchased from one of your retail stores in the area. We believe this product poses an unreasonable harm to\\r\\nconsumers and is unfit for public use. In particular, we experienced that this product causes nausea and headaches from what we deduce are either toxic or noxious fumes being released from the materials contained in the flip flops. I\\u2019m\\r\\nuncertain whether this incident is isolated to a small group of this product or your entire line of flip flops for this model. However, we believe that it\\u2019s important to bring this matter to your attention. We discovered the problem within the last month when [REDACTED] awoke in the night at the smell of a burning rubber or plastic scent. He initially thought that it came from the central heater or an electrical burning from an outlet or another device. In turn, we vented the home using fans and windows to dissipate the odor because we were suffering headaches and some nausea from the smell. He was not able to locate the source for several days until he traced it to the Old Navy shopping bag, where he identified the Sparkle Flip Flops as the source of the burning scent. We relocated this product to another room, and then relocated it\\r\\noutside after we verified that this product was releasing a very strong noxious odor throughout an enclosed area. Although the product's odor is heavily perfumed with a sweet scent, it appears unable to mask the noxious industrial fumes emanating from the product. Thus, we are holding the product until further instruction (i.e. product testing or inspection) and notifying you of the problem because it seemingly affects human health. We hope that we may still return it for a full-refund if the period for returns expires before getting instructions. Our family has generally had positive experiences with your products given the value versus price, but items like this should not be qualified for sale to the public. I\\u2019ve documented the product with photos to facilitate your identification and am attaching them with this letter for your reference. Please confirm receiving this letter and let us know what your company intends to do to protect consumers from\\r\\nthis item.\",\n",
       " u\"I have a pair of sketcher roll type shoes. I had been rolling on them all day because this is suppose to help tone your legs. I had just gotten home from work and was going out the back door on to the deck to talk to my husband. As I opened the back door I rolled my foot forward, the shoe got stuck in the door and I lost my footing and fell. My foot was facing backward and my back was hurting so my husband called the ambulance. At the hospital they had to put me to sleep to reset my big bone that runs from my knee to my foot. I had to see a orthopedic who did sugery on me. I have a pilor fracture with other complications and will not be able to work for at least 3 months IF all goes well. I also will have to have alot of therapy so I can walk on this foot again. I have a metal plate and 13 screws, at this time I have 15 staples on the outside of my leg and 12 staples on the inside of my leg. This is very painful and depressing. If this shoe had not made me trip I wouldn't be going through all this pain.  \",\n",
       " u\"I started wearing the Sketcher's Shape-ups around 6-8 months ago.  I work in a hospital, and walk between 3-4 miles a day, 3 days a week while at work.  About 3 months ago, I noticed a marble sized bump on my achilles tendon, but didn't think much about it, because it didn't hurt.  Right after that, I noticed that on my heel, there was a protrusion.  It feels like my bone is bumpy.  It was real tender to touch.  Recently, I have had tremendous pain upon getting up in the morning, and standing after sitting for any length of time. I can hardly walk at first.  My heel and tendon is really tight, and painful.  After I am up and about, and walk on it for awhile, it loosen's up, and is less painful to walk on.  I went to my podiatrist last month, and he diagnosed it as enthesopathy, and prescribed a night brace.  I wore the brace for the first few nights, and the pain wasn't there in the morning, however, I cannot sleep with the brace.  It's big, cumbersome, and makes my heel burn for the first hour or so.  VERY hard to sleep with.  I am planning on making an appointment with my primary physician, to see what he says about it.  I have since quit wearing the shoes, and really hope that this will remedy the problem.  I am hoping this injury is not permanent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can't say for sure if the shoes caused this, but all I know is that when I am off for 5-6 days in a row, and not wearing the shoes, my foot seems to not hurt as bad, especially when I am usually barefooted, but after working one shift, the next day, it's extremely tight and painful again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the reason I have this problem with the shoes is because I walk heavy on my heels (which is why I liked them, they put no pressure on the heel), but at the same time, I think I step down on my heel hard, and it has pulled the tendon.\",\n",

       " u'I purchased the \"Rainier\" style ladies shoes by Terrasoles (www.terrasoles.com), a brand owned by the R. G. Barry Corporation in mid-September, 2010. I got them at a high-end shoe store in the Washington, DC area. The shoes are extremely comfortable, but I noticed that they seemed as though they would easily slide on a smooth, polished flooring surface, such as those found in airports & train stations. They were fine outside, and I wore them a lot before the weather turned colder.\\r\\n I put them on again yesterday for the first time since last fall. I went outside, across my wooden porch, down one (wooden) step--and on the second (painted, dry concrete) step, my right foot slid out from under me, and I fell down hard onto the concrete steps. I was not in a hurry, and these are steps I have used several times each day for the past 10 years. They were not wet, and there were no obstacles. \\r\\n I now have a fractured/dislocated tailbone and a slightly sprained ankle, and am in extreme pain when not taking strong pain medication. I could easily have broken my back or sustained a head injury if there had been more than two steps remaining when I fell.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The shoes have a densely felted type of sole on the bottom. It is cross-hatched, but that is useless. My husband took one of the shoes and, with his hand inside it, placed it on our hardwood floors. He was amazed at how easily it slid--it\\'s basically the same type of material as you find on the bottom of those small furniture-moving pads, which are rubberized on the top & felted on the bottoms. \\r\\n\\r\\n    These shoes are an accident waiting to happen (as it did to me!), and I\\'m amazed the company hasn\\'t been sued for serious injury already.

I bought the shoes for comfort and if they helped me get back into shape while rehabbing my lungs that was a bonus. Around Thanksgiving of last year, I started noticing I was having a lot of pain in my legs. I thought maybe the rehab was a little much I had worked my way up to twice a week for 40 minutes each day. By Christmas, I was barely able to walk. People on my job were telling me to seriously think about going out on disability, because I looked horrible and in severe pain, which I was. The pain has intensified over the next few months. My doctor thought it was an allergic reaction to some medication, she took me off of it, but the pain was still there. My knees and feet were swelling so much that doctor and family thought my legs and feet would explode from the pressure or they would have to make cuts in my legs and feet to drain off the excess fluid. My toes looked like tiny stuffed sausages sitting under a honeydew melon. I am taking Viocodin for the pain, can't take any hard stuff  - Motrin and others. The pain keeps me up at night, my knees pop and lock all day long. There's burning up and down my thighs and the muscles in my thighs feel flexed and tight all the time. Finally doctor sent me to physical therapist and knee specialist, after cortisone shots in both knees and X-rays showing no damage pain was back after a week.

       " u\"I bought New Balance toning shoes for my birthday with my mom.  I had been wanting them for sometime and they had the nicest sale price.  Within three weeks of wearing them I had 2 sprained ankles so severely I need two MRI's next week.  My left one may be ok with physical therapy but my right foot is so bad, the foot doctor said it definately needs surgery.  It has been about 3 weeks since the right foor has rolled in these shoes and it continues to give out on flat ground even.  I am 27 an avid runner and weigh 135 lbs.  This isnt fair and extremely angers me that I am now limited when I did nothing but stay in shape.  My left ankle is swollen yet and my right anle is the size of a baseball yet and clicks and cracks constantly.  I am now forced to wear braces that costed $100 a piece on both ankles to do everyday activities.  Ridiculous.  \",\n",

       " u'I bought a pair of Skecher Tone-Ups fitness shoes in February of 2011, mainly to use while exercising and walking. I wore them sporadically for two months, mostly on the weekends while running errands and some hiking. On April 23rd, we had relatives visit us here in the Washington DC area, so we went with them on a walking tour of the capitol area, seeing the memorials, the Capitol building, and the White House. All told, we probably walked about 10 miles. I was wearing the Tone-Ups during this time. The next day (Sunday, April 24th), I noticed a sharp pain in my right foot, on the outside part near my little toe. I attributed it to a possible pulled muscle or strain, due to the amount of walking the previous day. I figured it would get better over time, so I just went about my usual routine. After about a week and a half, the pain was persistent, so I called an made an appointment with a podiatrist (this was on Monday, May 2nd, and the appointment was on Tuesday, the 3rd). On Monday afternoon, as I was walking home from work, I felt something pop in my foot, which was followed by more intense pain. The next day, the podiatrist Xrayed my foot and found that I had fractured the fifth metatarsal in my right foot. The popping sensation was caused by the complete fracture of the bone, which obviously had a stress fracture that caused the initial pain. When I told the doctor about the Tone-Ups shoes, he said that they were not good to wear, and they can cause problems, like what I experienced. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am an active walker, and I usually walk at least 3 miles everyday, most of which is to and from work during the week, in dress shoes. I have never experienced problems in the past like this. I am convinced that the Skechers caused the issue that led to the fracture. These shoes should be taken off of the market.',\n",

       " u'I purchased Sketchers Shape-Up toning sneakers in December 2010. In February 2011 I fell while walking outside on the sidewalk in these sneakers for no apparent reason.

       " u\"June 2010, I purchased cheap pair of wedge-heeled flip-flops from local Walmart store in Toledo, Ohio to wear to the pool. August 2010 I noticed nickel-size red, itchy, dry, and cracked painful spot of irritation on the sole of my right foot. I also observed two similarly painful spots on both feet, but predominantly on the right foot, where the back straps that fit into the bottom of the shoe came into contact with my feet, and a small round dry spot on the side of right foot where the flip-flop strap wrapped around my foot. August 2010, I stopped wearing the shoes. Left foot was okay after that.  However, the health and condition of right foot became progressively worse. It became hot to the touch, red, swollen heel, thickened, peeling, flaking skin, blisters, bleeding spots, color changed from healthy pink to dark blue/purplish, in addition to the symptoms already mentioned at the start. I was unable to wear a whole shoe. Ultimately, I had to wear whole shoe due to the change in weather from warmer temperatures to very cold temperatures. Pain in the foot became so unbearable that November 2010 I began to seek medical treatment. The agony and pain drove me into Toledo and Flower hospital emergency rooms where I saw medical professionals who attempted to relieve the pain, although they were not sure what was actually causing the pain. I was prescribed  antifugal and antibacterial creams and pain medication. I was told to visit my primary care physician, which I did and he began to refer me out to other medical professionals/specialists for diagnoses and testing. Over a 6 - 7 month period, I have visited  two dermatologists, an internal medical care physician, a podiatrist, a vascular care specialist, and a neurologist. I also have an appoinment to be seen by an allergist. I have been prescribed antibiotics, narcotic pain medication, nerve pain medication, clobetasol steroid cream and ointment, along with antibacterial cleansers and lubricating creams, lotions, and ointments. I am still unclear as to my exact diagnosis but the doctors have treated it as an eczema/allergic contact dermatitis. Research has shown that flip-flop sandals sold and distributed by Wal-Mart come from China. These sandals have been pre-treated with a combination of chemicals known to cause blistering burns to the feet. These caustic and toxic chemicals have been identified as Thiuram and Dithiocarbamates. I am concerned that as innocent consumers, many people who have purchased, or will purchase these sandals will have to endure the pain, suffering, medical costs, overall interruption of one's routine of life due to the injuries they have caused. The manufacturers should, out of good faith, attach a warning label on these shoes indicating that caustic chemicals, such as the ones named in this complaint, are used to manufacture and produce these shoes so that the consumer can decide for themselves if they want to deal invite the effect of these chemicals into their lives. I work for the State Public School system as a traveling Special Education Tutor, serving 3 different elementary schools, tutoring 13 students each school day. This serious foot condition has caused me much pain and suffering, medical bills, and loss of income due to a significant number of missed days of work because of not being able to walk or stand on the foot. The problem was not limited to the skin, but has resulted in several layers of skin burned with resulting nerve damage. When walking, I had to walk on my toes to avoid pressure on the bottom of my foot. I had to wear shoes without enclosed heels to avoid pressure on the my heels. Eventually, I had to resort to a surgical/diabetic shoe to have a shoe of some sort to wear. I still have the shoes and I want to report that I had none of these problems until I wore those shoes. \",\n",
       " u\"To whom it may concern...\\r\\nHello my name is [REDACTED] I am writing to report my incident regarding the Sketcher Shape up shoes. On Feb 11th 2011 I was returning from home from work. I was jogging to my front door from my car in my apartment complex. The stairs were coming up as I went to stop I felt my ankle roll completely over. I felt my ankle come out of the joint, immediately there was great pain. I fell to my behind to inspect the ankle in seconds it was twice its normal size and already turning a bruise color. I tried to stand on it in great pain I could not put any weight on it. Unfortunately I was unable to see a doctor for I have no medical insurance. I could not place any weight on it for about 4 weeks. I swelled to almost 3 times the size of my normal size and was bruised half way up the leg. I remedied my ankle using home remedy and bought a walking air cast. It\\u2019s been almost 4 months and I am still experiencing serious pain along with a terrible popping noise. I\\u2019m sure my ankle will never be right again. I missed four weeks of work and missed out on allot of money. Clearly these shoes are unsafe. They are very unstable and roll the ankle very easily I wasn't doing anything abnormal just jogging and coming to a stop. I recommend these shoes be taken off the market, a full recall and refund for the safety of all consumers. Please do not where these shoes! This is not a coincidence! I know many people who have suffered injury while wearing these shoes. So please take my report and put it to good use.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " u'I was walking to the elevator in my Sketcher Shape-Ups Toning Strength sneakers when the left shoe sole pivoted inside along the sole, shifting my center of gravity suddenly. The shoes caused me to lose my balance and my ankle roll around in the socket and made a \"pop\".  These shoes are  heavy and I had to struggle to hobble back to my apartment, which also hurt my entire foot, ankle, and lower back.  My ankle was bruised and swollen and extremely painful.  I am very angry because these shoes caused the tibialis in my left leg and permanent damage to my ligaments. ',\n",
       " u\"I purchased two pairs of Skechers shape up sneakers as they stated they would help with posture and tone up your body. I purchased the sneakers at two different times. The first pair was purchased approximately April 2010 but I had not worn the sneakers for more than a day or two at a time for the first few months. Because I hadn't felt any ill effects due to only wearing the shoes a couple times I purchased another pair while on sale a few months later as they were a comfortable shoe. However, after wearing the shoes for approximately 3 months on a consistent basis I started experiencing an excrutiating pain in my heels. I never had foot problems/pain prior to wearing these shoes for several months. The pain was and still is excrutiating and as a result I now have difficulty walking. I have not worn the the shoes since November 2010 and the pain in my heels has not receded or gone away.\\r\\nThe sore I purchased the shoes from allowed me to return both pairs even though the one pair had been worn.\\r\\nI have been seeing a massage therapist periodically to try and relieve some of the pain and have been told the pain will never completely go away but there are a few things that I can do to help alleviate the pain. My massage therapist indicated the injury was a result of the shoes due to the change in posture. As I lay here in bed right now trying to relax while typing this information my feet are in pain and I can not put pressure/weight on them without pain.\\r\\nIf there is any further information needed I can be reached on Monday throught Thursday at [REDACTED] between the hours of 6:00 AM and 4:00 PM ET.\\r\\nThank you,\\r\\n[REDACTED]\",\n",

       " u'In Feb. 2009 i purchased a pair of the skecher shape ups i used them daily at work. All was well til Sept 2010. I started experiencing severe legs cramps nightly. I then noticed a bruise on the side of my left knee which i still have to this day and also a lump on my shin bone. The lump was most disturbing as i had lymphoma cancer (and anytime a lump is present after cancer) it is quite alarming. I HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY APPTMTN with my oncologist to have a pet scan. It was a horrible experience, as it made me relive a time in my life that was very traumatic. Thankfully it was determined that the lump is not cancerous. It is said to be a cyst. i attribute to those sneakers and the brusie on the side of my knee as well as vericose veins (by the bruise). I have nt been to a doctor with regards to the lump/cyst and bruise. I was just releived to find it was not cancer. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince throwing out the sneakers, i have not had any further leg cramps.

After talking to [REDACTED] on the phone, it was determined that the common product was visco elastic, which is the memory foam.  The spring mattress also contained a layer of memory foam, or visco elastic.  I feel like it is the visco elastic, and not the fire retardent material, because I was just given some Nike flip flops, which also contains 8mm of memory foam in them.  I broke out from them also, and I would guess that they don't contain a fire retardant product, although that is just a guess.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",
       " u\"In August of 2010 I bought the Reebock Eazytone Sneakers, About 3 months ago, I began having foot pain. I waited about 10 days, but the pain did not subside so I went to the Dr. X-rays were taken and I was diagnosed with a stress fracture in my 2nd metatarsal. I was put in an orthopaedic boot for a few weeks to let it heal. When I returned for a follow up, I was told to only wear sneakers for a few weeks, just to be sure we had given the fracture enough time to heal. So I started wearing my Reeboks again. Within 2 weeks the pain returned. The doctor put be back in the boot again for another 3 weeks. Again I was told to take it easy, wear nothing but sneakers, and come back for a follow up. So I did. Then I heard the rumors about the toning sneakers causing stress fractures. Not finding any concrete information about it on line, I decided to ask my orthopaedic what he thought on my follow up visit May 18th. Unfortunately, on May 17th I began having pain in my foot again...by the end of the day I couldn't bear weight on it. At my appointment the next morning I was diagnosed with a 3rd stress fracture (on a different metatarsal this time). I didn't bother asking my orthopaedic what he thought because at this point, I'm convinced those shoes are the reason I've spent the better part of the past 3 months in a boot, on crutches, or both. I only wish I had know about this before the trouble began!!! \",\n",

       " u\"Two years ago in August my foot started to swell and I was unable to move my foot or leg. I went to the hospital and clinic and they could not see what caused my foot to swell and be in so much pain. I then went to a orthopedic Dr. and he ex-rayed my leg and said I had a stress fracture. He said what did you do and I said nothing. He indicated that I had to hit my leg very hard for it to start cracking. But I didn't. So they immediately put a cast on it. After 6 weeks my leg got worse it actually broke. So they put another cast on it. Six weeks later my leg still was not healed. The Dr then called in a surgent and they had to operate on my leg. Dr surgent said that my leg was not healing and that he had to put a plate and screws in it. (All this time I am in a wheelchair because I could not use this leg at all) I had a bone density test 3 years prior and everything was normal, so they ruled out that something was wrong with my bones. Twelve weeks after the surgery and my leg started to recover my other leg had the same symthoms, my leg stop moving.  I went back to the Dr. he was baffled. He said this is one in a million that you would have the same exact facture, same ex-ray just the opposite leg. Because the other leg did not heal on its own, we proceeded to do surgery on this one as well. By the time we did the surgery it was two weeks my leg had broke, just like the other one. In the second leg the Dr. ran a long nail down my leg, from my knee to my ankle and put screws at the knee and ankle. I just got out of the wheelchair 2 weeks ago and I am currently using a walker to help walk again. I am currently going to an bone Dr to determine why this has happen, they can't understand this. they say this is not normal. I then hear about the sneakers that I purchased. Which I brought 3 pair just 1 week before my leg stop working.\",\n",

       " u\"I had high hopes of toning my maximus gluteus according to the advertisement for the Shape-Ups.  After wearing only these tennis shoes for 2 months, my left knee became very swollen and painful.  I found it almost impossible to bear any weight on that leg as it was so very painful.  I took Ibuprofen and iced the knee, but, no relief.  I finally took my problem to my primary care physician.  Upon a physical examination, he initially thought it might be a Baker's Cyst.  He gave me some pain pills and an prescription for Naproxen as well, also advising me to ice the site.  I followed his instructions, but saw no relief.  I went back in to the physician after 4 days and he sent me for an MRI, which revealed several miniscus tears.  The timing fit the acquisition of the shoes and I had been told by several of my fitness center friends that they had suffered the same results after wearing the shoes for a month or so.  I have been advised by an sports orthopedic doctor that surgery should be considered to repair the tears.  I am very reticent to have surgery, but, I suppose it will be necessary to get me back to the ability to exercise, or to even walk without pain and limping!\",\n",

       " u'On a trip to Washington DC with my family, we balanced our sight seeing experience by bus, boat and walking.   On one of the walking days, I rolled my left ankle to a very painful extreme.  The rocker bottom and height of the Skechers Shape Ups that I was wearing caused the roll and accentuated the extent of my injury.  As a result, I ended up with a 2 1/2 cm tear in the peroneal tendon of my left ankle.  The healing process required two surgeries, 20 doctor visits, 70 days of missed work, 76 days in 6 different casts, 112 days in a brace support for walking, 900 minutes of physical therapy, 450 minutes of home therapy and 42 days of strict bed rest.  From all of this recovery, I had to check myself into [REDACTED] to help return my body to its \"presketchers\" shape and weight--a far cry from the shapely body they promise as a result of wearing these shoes.  Prior to this injury, I had been wearing shape ups for about three months, gradually building up a tolerance before wearing them for extended periods of time.  It is now 18 months after the first surgery and I still cant wear regular shoes--I am only able to wear flip flops or clogs due to continued swelling accompanied with pain on the left ankle.  This has greatly reduced my ability to exercise or travel by foot.  I have had to make many lifestyle adaptations including a new top load washer/drier and a heightened toilet to name just a few.  I cringe whenever I see someone wearing Skechers Shape Ups.  They have changed my life in a very adverse way.  Losing the gift of my left ankle has been the greatest handicap in my life.  Skechers Shape Ups are responsible.  The general public needs to be informed of the great risks involved with wearing these shoes.  If I could go back in time knowing what I know today, i would never have laced up in Skechers Shape Ups.        \\r\\n',\n",

       " u\"I purchased a pair of Sketcher's Shape up sneakers to tone my legs and buttocks. I am a nurse and spend a lot of time on my feet, and thought I could put that time to good use. After wearing them for approximately three months I noticed some tenderness and pain in my left instep, arch, heel and bottom of my left foot when I took them off. I did not fall or turn over on my ankle while wearing them. It was a gradual injury over time. I had to go to my doctor because I could no longer stand the pain in my foot and ankle. After an x-ray and MRI of my ankle it was determined that I had torn ligaments and tendonitis in my left foot and ankle. I cannot explain the excrutiating pain that I experience in my ankle, especially at night while trying to sleep. I have lost countless hours of sleep, plus I must wear an ankle brace both during the day to be able to walk and one at night in able to sleep. I am taking pain medication round the clock. Ultimately I will need surgery to correct the damage that was done to my foot and ankle.These people need to be held accountable for this damage. I know that I am not the only person in this situation. Not only do they NOT tone muscles, they injure them instead.   \",\n",
       " u'Bought Skechers Shapeups at Kohls April 16, 2011.  Started wearing them for awhile each day in the house and around when going to store etc.  Started walking about a mile when the weather started being warmer about the end of May.  By about June 9th, I could barely walk or put much pressure on my legs and I kept waking up in the night to switch sides to lay on.  I had about 3 trips to chiro in June with little relief, but he suggested on the first visit I quit wearing the shoes and I did.  Went to orthopedic surgeon on June 20, 2011 who did x-ray and indicated that the pain I was having down the inside and front of my legs was caused from my hips and he gave me a shot in each hip for bursitis which I had been treated for ten plus years prior but not since that time.  He said stress fractures wouldn\\'t show up on the x-ray, but he thought the cortizone shots would alleviate the pain and to not wear the shoes.  I am still in pain, but the tightness in my upper legs to my knees is a little better and the pain in my knees is intermittant.  The pain in my hips and sides of my hips are not much better and I am taking hydrocodone.  I slept well for about 5 days after the cortizone shots took hold, but have a constant ache now in my hips, upper thighs both inside and out and a pain in front of my leg above my knees.  I believe the Skechers are to blame and I do recall the feeling that these areas were being \"worked\" when I wore the shoes, but there was really no pain in the beginning.  I expected some sensation as these areas were worked so was not alarmed I was feeling a \"workout\".  It wasn\\'t until I woke up with severe pain that I realized something wasn\\'t right.  I made one last visit to chiro this past week, however, it did nothing to alleviate the pain.  I will be seeing my orthopedic doctor again in about a couple weeks as I want to allow some time to determine if it\\'s going to subside since I haven\\'t been walking for exercise since a few days before seeing the chiropractor the first time.

In the process my foot came down half on and half off the pavement. Then bottom of the shoes are rounded for new technique in exercise. Because if the rounding form it allowed my foot to slide sideways folding my ankle almost up to my leg. There was a very loud snapping sound as I feel to the ground losing all control of my momentun. I had lascerations on my left elbow and palm of my hand , along with numerous bruises, but the right ankle bone was already swollen as large as a baseball. My daughter helpd me off the ground and helped me get the 1 +1/2 back to the vehicle where we went straight to the Hospital. I did not let the hospital place a cast on my foot as I have no insurance or medical coverage nor extra money. i then called the Podiatrist recommended by hospital and talked to nurse. She set me an appt for the next morning early. (Dr said  was very lucky as these shoes are natorious for ankle injuries, and this is exactly what the nurses and techs from the hospital told also. many ankle injuries have been caused by these shoes.) He discovered that I not only broke the tip of a bone off in my ankle but also cracked a bone in the back. I am now in a cast for 4-6 weeks not weight baring at all in this time. I am to see him again on the 7/19/2011. I now have to have help doing every thing and am restrained from any of my normal activities.

       " u\"I was wearing Skechers Shape-ups at exercise class and when we bent over to touch out toes the shoes made me go too far forward and I hurt by back. I couldn't move well or bend at all for several days and went to the doctor. I got some exercises to do from him and he thinks it made me pull a muscle. I wrote Skechers and they offered me a percentage off on several of their shoes but said not to get tone-up or shape-ups and several other kinds since they have stability problems. \\r\\nI don't think they should be selling shoes that they know have these problems.\\r\\nI can forward you their email if you are interested.\",\n",
       " u\"I was walking in Sketcher Shape-Ups and turned to look to my side and slightly back when my foot rolled and I fell.  A neighbor helped me home as the pain was severe and I could not bear any weight whatsoever on my left foot.  I put my foot on ice and elevated it - hoping the pain would subside by morning.  By evening it was worse so I emailed my doctor telling him I was pretty sure I had broken my foot and asked him to order an xray Monday morning, which he did.  May 24,  he confirmed it was broken and referred me to an orthopedic surgeon whom I saw on May 25, and my left foot has been a boot ever since.  In a follow-up appointment my doctor said I could walk very short distances ...and on June 14, I put on my right-foot Sketcher ShapeUp and realized with its sole as it is, it gave me close to an even gait with the orthopedic boot on the left foot and the Sketcher Shape-Ups shoe on the right.  I headed to the mailbox and fell again - this time with my right foot rolling as I turned and broke the same bone in my right foot.  Until the second incident it didn't really occur to me that it was the fault of the Sketcher Shape-Ups - but now I'm certain.  Unless it were the shoes, it would beyond coincidental to break both feet in the same place under basically the same circumstances.  I have been housebound for the most part the past two months, and it's particularly inconvenient and expensive since I'm a senior residing alone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",
       " u'I purchased Sketchers Shape-up shoes due to being a server in a restaurant and being on my feet approximately 40 hours a week on a hard floor.  The shoes were being advertised to help take stress off of my back and to tone muscles. After wearing these shoes for approximately 4 months I began to have moderate back pain. I didnt realize that the problem was related to my shoes initially so I purchased another pair as the pain became greater eventually growing to a severe level and causing me to reduce my work hours to 25 a week with no doubles allowed any longer per Drs. orders. My doctor did an X-ray and found I have a deteriorating disk in my back which had been aggravated by an unknown source.  After taking pain meds and resting constantly when I wasnt working, my pain continues to be at the same level without any relief unless I stay in bed constantly with a heating pad. As a single person, that is impossible.  I stopped wearing these shoes about 3 weeks ago and so far there is little improvement. I have never suffered from any back condition in my life until I wore this product. I also had worked as a server for 2 years without any issues with my back until I wore these shoes. I firmly believe Sketchers shape ups are directly related and I will continue to seek medical treatment for this problem.',\n",

He agreed that it was the sandals and offered to let me return the sandals.  I told him I wanted to hang on to them in case the rash does not resolve on its own.  That I don't have insurance and if the sandals have some kind of chemical that burned my feet or makes me need medical attention at my expense (I don't have insurance) that I need them as evidence.  I let him know that if the feet get better on their own I will return the sandals.  He gave me his card and will wait for the outcome. They have a liberal return policy.  But it's not the return that is the issue.  It is the injury they caused.  And why. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have pictures of my feet with the sandals.  And I saved the e-mails to/from the company.

And felt some burning in legs and ankles but thought the shoes were suppose to do that. Then once I was able to take the time this summer to walk I started to wear them again. I walked up to about 2 to 3 miles once a day. One evening which was June 24th 2011, I put the shoes on to walk and got up the street and had to turn around because my ankle started hurting and took my shoe off and my left ankle was swelling. I couldn't walk that evening.

After several weeks of use I was experiencing severe pain in both lower extremities and my gait was severely impacted. I was actually fearful that I had some medical disorder. I stopped using the sneakers by mid to late February of 2010. My gait continued to be impacted and my leg pain although somewhat lessened still was present. On March 15, 2010 I was escorting a client by walking next to him. I turned and placed minimal weight on my left leg. I felt a sharp pain and heard an audible snapping or popping sound. I was unable to bear any weight on my leg at that time and needed to be assisted to  my office. I was seen by my primary care physician the following day and also had xrays. I also had an MRI which showed the torn meniscus. I was also seen by an orthopedic surgeon who indicated that I would need corrective surgery.

       " u'After spending months exercising by walking in Sketchers Shape Ups, I developed Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome in both lower legs. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was walking 3 to 5 miles a day in these shoes. Because of the rocker soles, the shoes force the wearer to pull up on the toes more, which results in over-developed muscles (specifically Tibialis Anterior) which then push up against the fascia during exercise causing extreme pressure and pain and loss of muscle control.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few months, the symptoms started. I was unable to walk a mile before I had to stop to alleviate the pressure and pain.  It finally got to the point where I could not walk a couple blocks before the pain and pressure started. \\r\\n\\r\\nI ended up having to go through Physical therapy and then a very painful surgery - Bi-Lateral Fasciatomies on February 25, 2011. The surgeon had to cut the fascia surrounding the muscle compartments in both legs so that the muscles would no longer cause pressure and pain. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 2 Doctors and the physical therapist stated that this condition was caused by these shoes. Compartment Syndrome does not occur in walkers - mostly runners and a few other sports, but not walking. But because of the way these shoes force the foot, ankle, and lower leg to be used in different ways, this injury occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started exercising in these shoes in June of 2010 and the surgery was February 25, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\n ',\n",

I looked down and the left shoe was flaming.I could not put it out. I ran for a shower. By the time I got there my trouser leg was on fire. I sprayed the flames with water which put out the fire. I put burn ointment on the injury. After looking at it closley I went to emergency at the hospital. This happined at the end of March. Today is the 3rd of August. I have been in the hospital. I have been to a Doctor. I have been to a burn center (hospitlized again). I have had a skin transplant. I am healing nicley now. I should be compleatly healed within the next several weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI E-mailed Sole with the details. My E-mail was not answered. Aproximatly 1 week later I E-mailed again.

Said the burn was my fault. Denied that their shoes were fireprone. Said that their shoes were just a slipper, and as such I should not have been wearing them while welding. Not true, their shoes are sold for everyday wear. I do have the partialy burned shoe and can mail it for your inspection if desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very least I do feel they should fireproof their shoes, or insert a notice with them advising that they are compustable. \\r\\n\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\n[REDACTED]',\n",

       " u'I am filing this report in the hopes it will save others from the injury I incurred while wearing Skecher Shape-ups sneakers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 17, 2011, I was walking with my husband in a local park.  I was wearing Sketcher Shape-ups sneakers and have worn them many times before.  We were walking a study pace as I approached a slight ramp from the street to the sidewalk.  As I stepped onto the ramp, my sneakers literally rocked me forward causing me to loose my balance and I landed flat on my face.  Upon falling, I slammed the sidewalk with my teeth and nose.  I have never tripped while walking before and went down so fast that I had no time to break my fall. My body lunged forward and I landed directly on my face.  I hit so hard and there was so much blood that I thought for sure I had lost my teeth and broken my nose.  The impact to my previously perfect straight teeth has caused them to shift, my nose now has a slight and probably permanent bump and I have a scar on my lip.  Unfortunately, it is still possible to develop an absess in my gums adversely effecting my teeth, so I will not know the permanent damage to my teeth for 6 months to a year.  My teeth are still sensitive to hot and cold four weeks after this incident, my nose is still very tender and I no longer have perfectly straight teeth.  However, at this time I still have my teeth and am thankful for that.  When this accident happened, my husband took me to the local emergency center in town, I have also visited the dentist 3 times for pain and shifting of my teeth as well as to a doctor for evaluation of damage to my nose.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion, the shape-ups should be taken off the market.  I am by no means accident prone, I feel the design of these sneakers can cause great damage to anyone.  I would rather be less tone and have my teeth.  After all, the health of your body is effected by the over all health of your teeth.    ',\n",

       " u\"I purchased Skecher Shape Up and Toning Shoes, either late last fall or shortly after the 1st of the year.  I have had issues with the feeling that one of my feet is turning out, but seemed to have gotten them broken in finally.  Then unexpectedly in July had searing pain in my left knee, as well as low back pain in the Sciatic area.  I have had back issues in the past, so didn't think anything of it, but have never had knee issues before, so didn't know what was going on.  I didn't have any injury that I could remember that would give me this intense pain.  After two weeks I went to my doctor to see what was going on as it wasn't healing.  I also have been having a great deal of hip and thigh pain.  He felt that I had irritated the menisci and had inflamed muscles in the knee and prescribed a 7 day course of Prednisone to help with the swelling.  At the end of the 7 days I was still not healed, so extended it for 7 more days.  I was starting to feel some relief, so 2 days ago I went for a short, slow walk in my Skecher shoes.  Now the issue is flared up again.  I am convinced it is from the shoes, especially after doing online research...  I am afraid that I will need to go to an specialist if it isn't healed soon.  I hope that something will be done to document all of these issues and warn consumers about potential problems.\",\n",

       " u\"I had purchased the skechers shape ups xf  , from  Jc penneys for $110.00+tax\\r\\nand I was excited to get them and try them do to the commercials saying how great they were\\r\\nto help women shape up. and I put them on and they did feel a little different then wearing \\r\\nregular sneakers , but I did want to give them a try so as I wore them for approx 2 weeks ,I had went to walmart and was walking from my car to store I fell and twisted my ankle (left) so I decided \\r\\nto go home and ice it and then the pain was getting worse and so I went the next day to the health \\r\\ndept and the dr. told me that I had fractured it and it would need surgery to fix it.

       " u\"On Oct 10, 2010 I was crossing the street and my left ankle suddenly rolled outward for no apparent reason.  I heard a popping sound and my left leg buckled.  I tried to regain my balance with right leg and that ankle rolled also.  I was in the middle of the street.  I managed to get myself the rest of way across and call for a ambulance.  The ambulance took me to the er.   A CT scan was done and my left ankle was broken in 3 places and my tibia was broken.  The right ankle has a severe sprain.  I had surgery the next morning.  Screws and plates were put in my ankle and a rod was placed along side the tibia bone.  I was in the hospital for six days.  I then had to have a second surgery to remove the rod and have a plate put over the tibia.  This was done because the tibia break was to close to the ankle and it wasn't healing completely healing because of ankle movement.  I was wearing skechers shapeup's (jumpstart) when this happened and i know without a doubt that these shoes caused this injury.   I had turned my ankle a couple times prior to this.  At one point i thought the shoes might be causing me to get off-balance, but then i thought these are tennis shoes that promote good health so that can't be it- i'll just be more careful.\\r\\nI now wish i had listened to first instinct and stopped wearing the shoes.  These shoes are dangerous and I can't believe there now marketing them for children.\",\n",
       " u'My name is [REDACTED]. I live in Cape Coral, FL and I am a 23 year old mom. I bought the Reebok EasyTone shoes (#55027665) about a month and a half ago to tone my buttocks after having a baby since I read the ads about how well they will tone you. The shoes haven\\'t helped but instead caused me to roll my ankle. I was wearing them yesterday when I took my daughter for a walk in her stroller when I rolled it. It was because the sole on the bottom of the shoe made my foot unstable and it rolled out and in turn I fell in the grass and was unable to stand up for a few minutes. I\\'m not overweight in any way, I weigh 125 lbs. and I\\'m 5\\'5\". I have very strong legs but I wanted to tone myself more beacuase I am young and want to look great after having a baby. My ankle is swollen and bruised. When I woke up today and opened the paper I saw the claim against Reebok and I\\'m intersted in hearing more and seeing if I have a claim. In any sort, as I said, I am a single mother and can\\'t afford to go to the hospital to get it checked out in fear of having a debt I cannot afford. If you could please contact me, my email is  [REDACTED] and my home phone number is  [REDACTED]. Thank you.',\n",

       " u\"On 12/14/10 I bought my wife a pair of Reebok EASYTONER shoes which I gave her for Christmas. After a week of use of these EASYTONER shoes she experienced pain in both ankles more noticeably her right ankle and it became increasingly more difficult to use the EASYTONER shoes for any length of time.\\r\\nOn 1/12/11 she went to a foot doctor who administered her ankle a cortisone shot to address the pain. This shot had a very limited affect. ($135). We are on a fixed income and she has no medical coverage so we need to exercise restraint in encountering medical expenses. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe had to limit her use of the EASYTONER shoes but the pain in the right ankle became increasingly worse so on 5/23/11 she went back to the foot doctor. He took x-rays of her right ankle. From these x-rays the ankle appeared to have experienced a hairline stress fracture. He fitted her with a cast boot ($405). The boot limited the movement of her ankle and brought some relief. Several weeks later the boot was removed and the pain again began to increase. She stopped using the EASYTONER shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of June, because of the continuing pain, she had to return to the foot doctor. More x-rays were taken and she was given a shoe insert for a regular shoe. (not billed yet) The insert only made the pain worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7/11/11 she went to her regular doctor. He diagnosed that she had experienced the onset of gout in the right ankle injury which occurred around the end of December and which was shortly after she began using the EASYTONER shoes. Her mother had gout so apparently my wife had a propensity for gout developing in a fracture. She was given pain medication and medication to address the gout. (lab $277; doctor not yet billed). This condition and the pain is expected to be with her for quite some timed. She now has to use a walker to ease the pain enough to get around.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn't until this Reebok case became public that all the pieces came together chronologically to see the impact of the EASYTONER shoes and the subsequent injury.\",\n",

Realized that feet were hurting all the time during exercise, decided to stop using the Shape ups and go to a regular pair of running shoes.

Made an appointment with family doctor beginning of the summer he took a regular x-ray, couldn't determine the problem, gave me shoe inserts for added support. He told me if this didn't help I need to go to a foot doctor. Inserts did not help. Finally got in with foot doctor in the early fall.

       " u\"Since summer 2010 I had worn Skechers Shape Ups shoes and sandals. In the beginning, these shoes were helpful for my leg and balance problems. I was healing post cancer treatment, and I have lymphadema in my left leg.  Due to some pain,  I had  an MRI done on my right hip in the fall of 2010 which showed arthritic inflammation. I did not connect this to my shoes, so I continued wearing them. As time went on, my right hip pain worsened. By August of 2011 my hip pain was so severe that I couldn't walk for exercise, and there were times I could not walk at all. It would keep me up at night. I was taking two to four Advil a day just to keep it from hurting so much that I couldn't walk.  In September I made an appointment at Midwest Orthopedic. I saw [REDACTED]'s physician assistant, [REDACTED].  They took X-Rays which did not show any fractures. However, after a thorough physical exam, [REDACTED] stated that I did have arthritis in my right hip. He gave a specific diagnosis which I can provide paperwork for. He said that my hip was degenerative, and pinching a nerve to cause pain. I asked him if my shoes, the Shape Ups, could be the cause. He said that he had read reports that those shoes did cause hip problems with extended wear. He had not seen any scientific reports about it at the time. He did state that his practice no longer recommended their brand of Shape Up type shoes, because of the links to injury and arthritis. He prescribed physical therapy.  I was able to link my hip pain directly to my Shape Ups, because the week after I saw the PA, I switched to [REDACTED] shoes. My hip pain is virtually gone. I am left with a degenerative condition in my hip that I believe is due to Shape Ups. This is a danger product that was marketed to help with leg muscles, balance, joint pain, and circulation. Instead it gave me arthritis in my hip. I am very unhappy about this product and the claims they made. \",\n",

I was told there was a cyst on my spine and fluid was leaking out and causing an inflammation.  I was referred to an orthopedic specialist who carterized nerves in my back but it did no good.  Before they were finished with all the procedures they refused to see me any more because I didn't have money to pay off the bill.

Two nights ago (10/23/2011) I had to be taken to the emergency room due to extreme pain in my left hip (completely unrelated to my fibromyalgia and something I had never felt before).  The very first thing the ER doctor told me was to immediately take off my Skechers Shape Ups!!  The doctor had seen himself numerous injuries and painful nerve issues caused only by these shoes!  The doctor also directed me to several websites with information on the kinds of dangers these shoes pose as well as possible law suits.  The number of testimonials I read regarding the dangers and damages do to the shoes is staggering and completely shocked me!

The Salesperson recommended the shoe for running long distances and on the inside of the shoe box, Skechers made the following claim: \\r\\n\\r\\n\"The key to Shape-ups LIV by Skechers is the curved bottom. It guides you back to the body\\'s barefoot stride. 1) the Diagonal SmartShoe bottom adjusts your stride...2) so the motion of each step naturally aligns your body\\'s center of gravity...3) and promotes fluid transition as you walk jog or run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA brochure and DVD inside the box made similar claims. \\r\\n\\r\\n[REDACTED] began wearing the shoes to train for a half-marathon, starting with short distances.

By the time she had driven home after completing the run, the pain had become so severe that she was unable to walk into her house. That day, she received acute care from Certified Family Nurse Practioner [REDACTED] who diagnosed her with Plantar Fascitis and said that the condition could easily be attributed to the shoes she was encouraged to buy because the shoes had inadequate arch support.

I also walked 3-5 miles at night wearing one of the 3 pairs. I wore one of the 3 pairs 7 days a week from late July until mid-November. I was walking in the New Balance in August, lost my balance and fell. I have never lost my balance and fallen I was a little stunned when it happened because it seemed so odd. It happened once more a few weeks later and again I thought what the heck how did I just fall. I started having severe pain in my buttock bones I thought it must be from the fall although I fell forward on my knee not on my butt. I couldn't figure out why I had such severe pain in the buttocks. I went to the Dr. in late Sept and had an x-ray because I was experiencing such pain. It got to the point that I could not bend over or go up a flight of stairs without extreme pain. The xray did not show any type of break. The Dr. said maybe hairline fracture. Nothing I could do. By Nov I was in agony, still am, so I [REDACTED] butt bone pain. I came across a lot of info on the [REDACTED] and New Balance toning, shaping shoes. I saw that people were complaining of the same simptoms as I was having. I realized that it was the sneaks. I thought it was the fall but then realized that the shoes are what made me fall. It all made sense. I immediately stopped wearing the shoes but I am still in such pain almost 2 months later. Going up a flight of stairs is agony. Bending over is just as bad. I have always been very active. I have never had a hip, foot, leg, back, buttock bone, or tailbone problem in my life. Now I am in pain all the time. I cannot move in bed at night. I have to sit up to move from one side to the other and then I cannot stay on my side for very long because my hip bones hurt so badly. I am a person that was very active. I do a lot around the house for myself and also for others. Not anymore. This pain has severely limited my activities and it is actually very depressing. Something needs to be done to make these shoe companies pull these shoes off the shelf. I am afraid that I am in for this pain for the rest of my life and it is making me ill just thinking about this. I never dreamed that a shoe could do so much damage but I am living proof that it has. Please tell me what recourse I may have againest these two companies. My insurance does not cover physical therapy or chiropractor services. I don't even know if they would help but I just want the pain to go away so I can get back to normal. Thank you!\",\n",

       " u'I have recently been treated for the pain associated with both my knee caps wearing out. I am 43 years old and have worn Sketchers Shape Ups for walking nearly 45-50 minutes nearly every day for about 1 1/2 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sept 30, 2011, I went to my PCP for excruciating pain in both my knees. He ordered \"sun rise\" x-rays on both knees. I was prescribed [REDACTED] and then [REDACTED], which caused me severe heart burn, which I treated with [REDACTED]. The x-rays seemed to be normal. My knee pain got progressively worse. Oddly enough, it is worst when I am sitting at my desk.  \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, I saw an Orthopedic doctor, because the pain has become unbearable. He did an x-ray of my right knee and he said, in layman\\'s terms,  both my knee caps are wearing out. I am developing arthritis. He gave me a cortisone shot in my right knee and I need PT. He told me to stop wearing the Sketchers immediately. In three weeks, I have a second visit to treat my left knee. \\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, when you walk or exercise, your knees are lubricated and when at rest, they dry out. My knees pop constantly, they throb and ache deeply and after sitting for an extended time, I can barely walk when I get up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have two pairs of Sketchers Shape Ups. When I bought them, I was amazed at how comfortable they were. I never had chronic, debilitating knee pain in my life. I believe these sneakers are dangerous and should not be on the market. I don\\'t know what the future holds for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bought one pair at Kohls and the second in Las Vegas in May 2011, at their brand new factory store. There was no DVD to view. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to know if my problem warrants further investigation. I would like to protect others from the pain and suffering I am living with today due to these sneakers.\\r\\n',\n",
       " u'I bought a pair of Earth Spirit Gelron 2000 shoes at Wal-mart.  The tag said they were leather and they looked quite comfortable so I paid $20 + tax for a pair of what I thought were good quality flip-flops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time I wore them, after a half hour the tops of both feet were red and itchy where the center piece sat atop my foot, resembling the shape of a triangle.  It took almost 2 weeks for the redness and itching to subside, and the skin still looked dry and rough.  So I thought perhaps there was some chemical residue left from manufacturing or something, and I cleaned the lining with some peroxide and dried it off.  Turns out the lining was vinyl, not leather, and the triangle section contained the black ink stamp with brand and content information.  \\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, after I wore the shoes just 4 hours, I had to return home and take them off.  My skin was beet red and looked like a 3rd degree sunburn with raised blisters full of clear liquid.  The itching was extremely intense, as well as the pain as I could not bear to touch them.  I put on solarcaine aloe gel every 2 hours to try to numb the skin.  I was unable to wear any shoe as they all involved touching the arch of my feet.  I have had vinyl-lined shoes throughout my life without ever having any experience such as this.  I cannot imagine what type of chemical can inflict this damage and I do not have the money to research the cause.  I only know that I am not the first one, after looking online I see there are many such incidents going on for 6 years already.  It is not an anomaly and I believe the manufacturer and Wal-mart should be held responsible for my pain and suffering.  My once-beautiful feet are now scarred for life, and I may wind up with cancer as a result--who knows? ',\n",

This was the first that I had heard that there was a problem with this type shoe, though I had purchased a pair myself and did not like them, because I noticed a tendency of instability when I walked across a driveway sloping downward. Upon reaching the ER of the Cottonwood Hospital, the orthopedic surgeon [REDACTED] also commented about the many incidents he had seen that were related to the wearing of this shoe, and said they were dangerous. X-rays showed the dislocation, and after a pain blocking shot, he \"reduced\" the dislocation, and X-rays again were taken which showed fractures of both side bones in the ankle. The operating room was scheduled, so he put a cast on her foot, and scheduled surgery for Monday, March 12. Following surgery, her foot again was put in a cast, with a follow-up scheduled for March 27. Her intense pain initially was to be controlled by Hydro-Codone, which was not successful, so prescription was changed to Percocet, which has been controlling her pain.',\n",

       " u\" I had recieved a pair of shape-ups from my grandma as a present for my birthday, because I really wanted a pair to try and help me get into shape. I wore my shape-ups like every single day for anything I had to do. One day in April 2011 I was playing with my daughter at the park, I was wearing my shape-ups, and I ended up falling due to my leg twisting and I had a sharp pain in my leg and knee. I thought I just pulled a muscle. I went to my dr a couple days later due to my knee swelling up and bruising, and his first thought was that I had a meniscus tear in my knee, and told me to stop wearing the shape-ups that I always wore. He ordered a x-ray, and that didn't show anything wrong. So then he ordered physical therapy, and a CT Scan and MRI. After we had gotten the results back, he ordered me to see a orthropdaedic specialist because as my family dr he was unable to figure out what was wrong. So I scheduled to see a specialist. I was unable to get a appointment with him until August 2011. So for roughly 2 months I wore several different types of knee braces to try and help the pain. The  entire time I waited to see the specialist I was in severe pain and kept seeing my normal dr due to the pain I was having. Finally I seen him and he asked what had happened and had me move my leg and knee certain ways, and documented the pain and reactions I would have to the certain exercises he had me do. He told me that what I had going on, that he could see from my MRI that I had done, that I had a patellofemoral disorder, and patellofemoral instability with pain and pain syndrome. He said the only way to get rid of the problem would be to perform a arthoscopic latteral release on my knee. He said that it wasn't a guarantee that it would fix my problem, but due to the amount of time that has gone on since the date of the injury, he believes this would be the only option left. So we scheduled my surgery for September 20, 2011, and that is when I had my surgery. I never linked my knee problem to my shoes, until my friend told me there was a lawsuit against the shape ups. I decided to look into it and realized that there were things that stuck out to me, such as one woman saying she had a meniscus tear due to the shoes, and then I checked into it because I in fact was wearing my shoes when my injury occurred. While talking to my husband after reading all this online, he reminded me that in fact months ago he thought it had been because of my shoes that I had this knee injury, because he had heard that they are not good for you, and also reminded me that the dr had recommended not to wear those shoes.  And Im not overweight or play any sports, so I really shouldn't have a injury to this degree just by playing with my daughter at the park. \",\n",

I remembered that I needed a paper clip to hold the papers together, so as I was getting up, I lost my balance and ended up falling on the floor on my buttock (to avoid falling on one of the children - they were napping on their cots).',\n",
       " u\"To whom it may concern,\\r\\n   We are Carters lovers however today's incident with the Carters Canvas Sneaker Crib Shoe could have gone very bad very quickly. My daughter is now 18 months but has been in heart failure and has also been on oxygen since birth. We are under strict instructions from her doctors to attempt to keep her heart rate below 200 until she has her open heart surgery May 7th.\\r\\n     We had errands to run this afternoon so my husband and I loaded up our daughter in the car. While I was strapping her in I also slid these shoes over her bare feet since it was warm outside. While I was getting our handicap placard or our car my husband said upon my arrival back to the car [REDACTED], our daughter, had been extremely fussy. I gave her some toys and turned het DVD player on. When we got into Lowes she had started to get worse. She started screaming and crying in pain. We could not figure out what was wrong. I mean screing bloody murder. I took her out to the car to calm het and she would stop crying and seconds later s team again. I went to stand her up on my legs and as soon as het left foot hit my legs she screamed uncontroably and recoiled her foot away from my leg. I instantly sat her down and slid the shoe off to find that her pinkie toe on her left foot was a deep reddish blue and swollen. It was so disfigured and the damage was so pronounced I thought it was broken. I immediately grabbed and ice pack from her formula cooler and she recoiled her foot obviously but also flexed the injured pinkie. By this time my husband was at the car and offered to hold her and help circulate her toe by massage her legs and pinkie. As soon as the shoe was off she was back to her happy loving self. Her toe returned to complete normal color about 45 minutes to an hour later. Upon examining the shoe I discovered that the elastic faux shoe laces come down the insides of the shoe. The only thing securing the elastic is the decorative classic sneaker stitching on the outside. In between those stitches the elastic is moveable and spots are plenty large enough to get my pinkie finger in. I am without  a doubt certain that when I put the shoe her toe caught that elastic band and it was straggulating her toe. I  bought these shoes for her from Kohls in Clarksville Tn and they are also listed on their website. The shoes  themselves are in good condition except for some discoloration to the bottoms from her toddling in het walker. \\r\\nWe haven't altered the shoes in anyway. I unfournately do not have the product code but I will add the direct   link go Kohls listing. Which I will paste below. Luckily my daughter was not napping or we had let that shoe on  another 20-30 minutes. She is developmentally delayed which is why she hadn't taking it off herself. If you  need any other information from us please let us know. Thank you.\\r\\n[REDACTED]\\r\\nhttp://m.kohls.com/kohlsStore/baby/girls_clothing/shoes_sockstights/shoes/PRD~870473/Carters+Canvas+Sneaker+Crib+Shoes++Newborn.jsp\",\n",

       " u\"I bought a pair of Sketchers Toning Shoes because my heart doctor told me to start a good walking program for my blood pressure and heart health.  About the 13th of April I started walking at Veterans Park, in Lehigh Acres, FL. About two or three days later I noticed a great deal of pain in my left foot. Sometimes when I was walking the foot would just turn over because the sole of this type of shoe is really wierd and cumbersome. I ignored it thinking it was just a strain. The foot got progressively more swollen and painful, and on 4/20/2012, I finally went to the emergency room knowing this was more than just a sprain.  They took xrays and told me it was a compression fracture, and to not wear those type of shoes again!  I can't wear any type of shoe right now, and can barely walk at all.  My heart health program is once again on the back burner, as walking is almost out of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you\",\n",

I have been crying and my friends and family just do not know what to do or say. I live alone and I can tell you that this has been the most difficult and painful experience I have every gone through in the my life and it is not over yet.

After many medical tests including an MRI, it was diagnosed as inflammation of the Achilles and Tibia tendons.  I have been in a boot up to my knees for the past six weeks and am undergoing physical therapy.  Both my orthopaedic doctor and my physical therapist told me to get rid of my shoes.

I was walking across a level brick area when I felt my right ankle twist, caving inward, and I fell to the ground, abrading by right knee and hurting my right ankle. After walking the six or so blocks home, I told my wife, a retired physician, what had happened, and she sent me to the ER at Hahnemann Hospital, where X-rays confirmed a displaced fracture of the right fibula. Since then I have had surgery on this ankle, and had a plate and upward of 10 screws put in to stabilize the ankle and allow it to mend. I am 58 years old, in good health, and have never had a fall or suffered a broken bone in my life. This is the first surgery I've required since my tonsils were removed as a child.

       " u'I was first drawn to Sketchers\\u2019 \"Shape-Ups\" ladies exercise shoes mid-year 2009 via multiple TV advertisements. These ads featured women walking, running and exercising wearing these shoes with \"stated\" results of losing weight, toning calf muscles and generally improving a person\\'s physical health. Consequently, I purchased one pair in December, 2009 and wore them each day, 4 to 5 days a week, walking at least 3 miles each day. While I imagined some benefits from wearing these exercise shoes, I also began to \"suddenly\" lose my balance during regular workdays...wearing regular, average height, high heel shoes. This didn\\'t occur every day...and on no occasion did my \"falls\" result in broken bones, but, the knowledge of some weakness in my legs and ankles became more and more pronounced so that I wore \"flat\" shoes often. Unfortunately I didn\\'t initially associate my issue of periodic \"imbalance\" and a low-grade constant aching feeling in my legs with the use of these shoes. And even more unfortunate for me was the fact that after that first full year I was shopping one afternoon an found that a store had \"shape-Ups\" on sale...so I brought another pair and proceeded to wear my new shape-ups through most of 2011. Currently, I have been to several specialist regarding the now constant \"pain\" in both my legs (not the knees) just the lower leg muscles. However, the doctors can\\'t find any evidence of diseased or neurological disorders. Yet, my mobility is severely compromised; I cannot sit for more than 20 to 30 minutes without having to hold on to something stable in order to get up. I can hardly sleep at night given the constant aching pain, can\\'t wear any type of \"dress\" shoe with a high heel and I can\\'t ascend or descend stairs at all. It was only a few months ago that a friend of mine (knowing of my mysterious leg ailments) asked me if were still walking everyday and wearing the \"shape-Ups\" I had previously raved about. When I told her no\\u2026 that I was not walking everyday anymore and therefore was no longer wearing the shoes, she told me about the \"Shape-ups\" recall and all of the consumers\\u2019 who have been in some way injured as a result of wearing the shoes. I simply would like to add my story in hopes that the company  eventually understands  how \"badly\" this product has impacted its intended audience and takes steps to try and \"right\" the wrong!',\n",

I wear a pedometer and walk an average of 15,000 steps each day at work.    I thought the shape up shoes would help me lose weight, and benefit my hips, back, and neck, as Skechers claims.  October 12, 2010 I was walking down stairs at work and my left ankle twisted and  bent over made a loud popping sound as I fell backward and landed on my back side. I was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  I had torn 2 ligaments in my ankle. I was off work for 2 1/2 weeks.  I filed a SAIF claim since it was an injury on the job.     I continued to wear Skecher shape ups but started noticing my feet were numb by the end of the day.  My feet and calves / shins felt tired and worn out.  I didn\\'t realize the shoes were the problem just yet because I had hoped the benefit claims where accurate.  I actually went to a doctor to see if my circulation was ok.  I thought I had other issues.  He said my heart and circulation was fine.  I go through shoes fast with my line of work and when I bought my 3rd pair, I decided to buy the lower profile shape ups which were 1 1/2 inches tall.   My feet still became numb, and my lower back ,neck, and left hip began giving me trouble  over the past year and I have been going to a chiropractor for relief.  I have recently been diagnosed with bursitis in my hip on the left side.  In February of 2012 I decided I was done wearing Skecher shape ups.  I felt my body was getting worse so I threw them in the dumpster at work.  I bought a regular pair of skechers  and have been wearing the flat regular shoes since.  I still have back, neck, and hip issues and feel older than I actually am. I have gained weight (6 pounds)  even though I take between 13,000 and 19,000 steps a day at work.   I am only 45 years old.  I have told my Chiropractor many times \"I am too young to be this old!\"   My body feels it has aged tremendously and I have also told him I can\\'t imagine getting old.  It scares me if I feel this bad now.     I have given my testimony to others who I see wearing Shape Ups hoping they will heed my warnings.

After x-rays the results were a knee effusion they put me on some pain medicine, steroids and a knee immobilizer. I was to follow up with my primary care doctor and possibly  get an MRI.  I was waiting on workers comp to help me with this but my supervisor failed to turn it in.  About 3 to 4 weeks later I saw my primary care doctor and was sent for an MRI.  Those test concluded in a torn meniscus and effusion.  I then went to see a Orthopedic Specialist. He reviewed my test and set me up for surgery. During surgery the doctor found that I had no cartilage and it was bone on bone along with the tear and effusion.  He then drilled holes in my bone so hopefully I could try to grow my own cartilage back.  I was not allowed to walk or put any weight on my knee for 8 weeks.  By October the doctor had sent me to Physical Therapy still using a walker and part time Cain.  I had to stop therapy in middle December due my insurance I was not able to afford it any more.  I saw the surgeon in January he said therapy was not working but wanted me in a brace to help with movement but I could not afford the hundreds of dollars a month for a rental brace.  I am still struggling with the pain in my knee. My husband has to work my leg nightly so its not as painful for me to walk with it. I did not have any problems with my knees prior to my fall and could lead a active life, since I have fell it takes more effort to get small things accomplished. The doctor has also told me I am no longer allowed to walk or run for exercise if I do I will end up with a total knee replacement.  Also my primary care doctor will no longer let me take any steroids for inflammatory problems. ',\n",

A little over a year later I purchased a new pair, then around Sept. or October noted a gradual worsening pain in my right hip; to the point I started limping at work and had coworkers ask me about it. I was so puzzled about this pain, as I'd previously had 4 surgeries to my LEFT foot and a LEFT bulging disc in my low back, so was used to problems happening on my left side. So, I performed my own test and started to wear regular tennis shoes, and this made the hip pain subside noticeably, but it still was there. I tried wearing them again a couple of months later just to test it again, and my hip started hurting again immediately after my shift was over and I knew it was the shoes. At some point it became both hips and I now struggle with chronic hip pain in both hips. I did a [REDACTED] search using Skecher Shape-Ups and hip pain, and there learned about the lawsuits for stress fractures of the hips caused by these shoes. I firmly believe I had a stress fracture initially due to the limping and pain, and sometimes after sitting I'd get up and the hip(s) would almost give out on me. I believe these shoes caused my chronic hip condition now, but have been unable to afford any diagnostic tests such as X-rays or MRI specifically for the hips. \",\n",

One day I was trying to walk a bit more quickly than usual because I thought I would get a better workout. I inadvertently stepped in a small hole in the street. Because I was wearing shoes that affected my gait and balance, I couldn't catch my fall, and I injured my left foot. When I went to the doctor and had x-rays, it was discovered that I had broken the far left metatarsal of my left foot. I had to wear an orthopedic boot for eight weeks while it healed. It was a simple break, and the doctor and orthopedist I consulted thought that it healed as well as could be expected. However, I've experienced swelling in the foot from time to time, and now, a year later, I've developed plantar fasciitis in my left heel. If you require statements from my doctors, please let me know and I will get them and provide them to you. Thank you.\",\n",

       " u\"I bought a pair of Skechers' Shake-Up shoes on Aug 18th, 2012. I had worn them for 3 months (from Sept 2012 to Nov 2012). Skechers used to claim their Shake-Up shoes can help to build your body. However, these shoes didn't work as they advertised and they cost permanent damage to my feet. During those three months, I used those shoes primarily for running and walking. Occasionally, I played Volleyball (around 4 times) in those shoes. Now I am diagnosed with Osteoarthritis on my big left toe. Osteoarthritis is rare among young adult (I'm 27 years old). My condition is definitely a result of wearing those shoes since I was extremely healthy before wearing those shoes and I had no injures on my foot before whatsoever. My life has changed dramatically after diagnosed with Osteoarthritis. I can't go to gym, play sports and hang out with friends like I used to do any more. Even walking now is a pain. My doctor says there is no treatment for my condition except surgery. However, surgery is not recommended at this stage considering I can still walk (even though in pain). Osteoarthritis can only gets worse with age and eventually a surgery is inevitable. I have already spent hundreds of dollars seeking treatment but there is no positive response from the doctors I saw. I am also worried about the surgery expense that I will have to to cover in near future which I couldn't afford for sure. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am devastating now and everything has changed after wearing those shoes. I feel disappointed with Schechers because they misled their customers and I doubt if they had run reliable experiments on their Shake-Up shoes before putting them into market. I feel Skechers should be responsible (at least partially) for what I am experiencing now and should take further action to prevent this from happening on any of their customers. \\r\\n\",\n",

Over the summer it got so bad I had to go to an orthopedic specialist who injected cortisone into my hip and sent me to physical therapy.

As I'm walking I felt a pinch and then felt constant discomfort. I went to check the shoe, and removed the memory foam insert all to find a metal sharp tack standing upright inside the left shoe, under the memory foam sole insert. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my disappointment, I immediately called customer service, and they refused to give me the contact information for someone at your company that would handle such claims. Skechers should really have a department available to speak with customer in a case such as this one. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have images, of the box, the shoe, and my credit card statement.

       " u'In February of 2014 I purchased a pair of Dr. Scholl\\'s Escape (2522966) walking shoes in anticipation of being on my feet a lot during a couple week trip to England for work. Very comfortable nice fitting shoes I wore the shoes a lot sightseeing when not working. However after the second week I noticed some reddening and peeling of the skin on top of both feet and a few days later the same on the bottoms but much worse. Thought maybe it was athlete\\'s foot or a fungus from the motel shower or carpet so I began applying antifungal cream to both feet. Thinking all was well and the problem would go away I continued to wear the shoes, after a while the skin on both feet on the tops and bottoms had started to crack and peel and had this burned appearance. Kept up with the cream and wearing the shoes thinking it would just take a while to clear up. After returning home to the states, my wife was shocked by the condition of my feet, the entire tops and bottoms of both feet were discolored (reddish brown to almost black areas) and looked like they had been burned. Then the peeling began the tops and bottoms of both feet completely peeled off several times at one point the pain was so intense I couldn\\'t hardly even walk and if I did the pain was excruciating. I went to the doctor and he said it was some kind of contact dermatitis and prescribed a cortisone cream which seemed to help, but it was the end of April before my feet were back to normal. During this time I had not done a lot of walking so I had not worn my \"walking\" shoes. Then the weekend of June 1 2014 I and my wife went to a local car show and being as I was going to be walking for several hours I wore my aforementioned \"walking\" shoes. The next morning noticed that that once again my feet looked as if they had been burned, and by mid week had started to crack and peel again. Not as bad as before but I only had the shoes on for a few hours instead of days and days.\\r\\nThis hardly seemed like a coincidence and thats when it occurred to me that it was the shoes causing the problem. Last week I saw a post on Facebook about a woman who had purchased some flip flop sandals from Wal-Mart that were made in China and that the materials and dyes they used caused major burning on her feet that looked just like my feet did and that made me think. My shoes were from Wal-Mart and as you can guess also made in China. Coincidence? I\\'m thinking not.\\r\\nNot sure about contacting an Attorney. Any suggestions?',\n",
       " u\"\\tI purchased a pair of Gold Lame' Knotted sandals from AVON, I did not wear them right away because I was looking for a handbag that would complement them.. The first time I wore them I took a friend to lunch and then we went grocery shopping and then we ran some errands. When I got home and took the sandals off I noticed that were the lower edge of the sandal touched my feet that they had caused scratches. They seemed minor as I washed my feet and falsely assumed that when the scratches healed that there would not be any further problems. I was wrong. I now have permanent marks on my feet where the scratches were. I asked my doctor about the marks during my regular six months check up. [REDACTED] told me that the marks would fade over time but, would not completely go away. He also explained that Gold Lame' is metallic and if not properly sealed if it touches raw skin it can cut you. I returned the sandals to my representative and she returned the sandals to AVON as she was trained to do. She also gave me the number for the customer complaint division of AVON.\\r\\n\\tThe person I spoke with acted like I was a mentally defective idiot. Her attitude was that I was either too stupid to buy the right size or if I was stupid enough to buy the sandals and then dumb enough to actually wear them then that was my own fault. In any case they now had the sandals so now I have no proof that they damaged my feet Ha Ha Ha. Fed up with her insulting attitude I wrote to the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Affairs Division of the Wyoming State Attorney Generals Office (who sent me this form) my Congresswoman, both of my Senators and, the CEO of AVON.

They stabilized my wrist but did not surgery.  The orthopedic surgeon on duty told me to see him in his office in two days.  When I went there he would not see me because I was un insured.  I made many calls to find a surgeon who would treat me without insurance.  I also tried unsuccessfully to apply for medical assistance and disability.  After six weeks I located the Union Memorial Hospital program that provides care for un insured individuals.  I was evaluated there and it was determined that at this point my wrist had healed incorrectly and to fix it would require surgery for re breaking and setting.  Next I had to apply for their program and it took another six weeks for approval.  When I received approval I was immediately scheduled for surgery in July 2011. They placed hardware inside to set my wrist.  Following surgery I was seen periodically for evaluation and occupational therapy.  In October 2011 I underwent a second surgery to remove the hardware.  This was followed by more evaluation and therapy for four more months.  I was discharged in February 2012.

She first wore these shoes on 7/15/2014 while at camp out of state.  When she did, she began having skin irritation, redness and rash and was treated by the camp nurse.  The nurse suggested it was \\u201csunburn\\u201d and applied a steroid cream daily for several days until the skin cleared.  After that, our daughter did not wear her Keds shoes again for more than 30 mins. (1 occasion, 8/14/14) until 8/18/14:  She wore her Keds to school with \\u2018footie\\u201d style socks and wore them the entire school day.  On the ride home after school dismissal, she was complaining of pain and itching and the tops of her feet were noticeably swollen and red in the area uncovered by her socks.  Her right foot had broken skin.  Her pediatrician\\u2019s office advised us to \\u201cwash and dry her feet and apply [REDACTED] and give [REDACTED], orally\\u201d and we did this. But, although her shoes remained off, her feet appeared to be getting worse and she complained of increased pain and itching.  She went to bed that night at 8pm but by 10pm was awake and in more pain.  At 2am on 8/19/14 her right foot was much worse. A large blister had formed over the entire top of the right foot and had popped open.  The skin was peeling away and the wound was raw, bright red and oozing.  We gave her OTC pain medication and [REDACTED].  We saw her pediatrician at noon on 8/19/14 and our daughter was diagnosed with 2d and 3d degree burns on her right food and 2d degree burns on her left foot.  Wound care for burns was initiated which involved painful cleaning, debridement, Rx wound cream and wound care bandaging.  She was prescribed a 10 day course of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] for topical use.  We were also advised to give her [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] for pain and itching.  Our instructions were to perform wound care procedures 2X daily, which were very painful for her.  She returned to school on 8/21/14 in doctor approved footwear and with restrictions on physical activity.  She was also treated by wound care specialists and a plastic surgeon who provided additional therapies and topical medications to aid in healing and the prevention of discoloration. She was released by the wound care specialists on 8/29/14 with the suggestion that she may have long term scarring or discoloration of her right foot.  She remained under the pediatrician\\u2019s care for her wounds until 9/17/14.

       " u'I purchased the Skechers Shape-Up sneakers in 2009.  I wore them for walking for approx. a year before developing micro tears in my right achilles tendon. This required physical therapy and ultimately surgery to repair the damage and then more physical therapy. Both my orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist agreed that the shoe was a causative factor in my injury due to the design of the show that basically has one walking on a soft, unstable, seesaw style type of sole.  As a result, the shoe caused the back of my foot (feet) to extend unnaturally low beyond the the point where it would normally stop if it were hitting the ground as it would in a normal soled shoe. Consequently, this caused undue pressure and strain on the tendon leading to injury. Four years later I am still plagued with problems.  My right achilles, is still weak from the injury causing me pain at times.  The pain increased this past summer and as a result, I started to favor my left foot and thus put too much stress on the left achilles, which has led to tendonitis in the left achilles tendon. I am now back in physical therapy and have been for 3 months. My left achilles is not improving and I may be faced with having to have another surgery.',\n",

Since I was experiencing pain,  [REDACTED] decided I should have surgery to remove it.  On, April 24, 2012, I had surgery to remove the bunion.

       " u'I began wearing new Skecher shoes around November 1-2,2013,walking 2 miles daily. In less than 10 weeks I was seeing a doctor for pain in my right foot. The pain soon moved to my sciatic nerve. I had many sleepless nights due to the pain and the doctors inability to assess the problem. In the mean time I had 2 epidurals to calm my sciatic nerve and took various pain medication. Around April 11,2013 my doctor told me, AFTER ITOLD HIM I BLAMED THE SKECHER SHOES I WAS WEARING, I had cracked bones in my foot along with a pinched nerve and sciatic nerve problem. The doctor recommended a boot which I wore 8 weeks. I then began to try to restore my foot and leg. (By this time I, also,had leg problems.) I joined the [REDACTED] to swim and use the exercise machines. I went to 2 chiropractors; had physical therapy;went to a massage therapist; a deep massage therapist; purchased a [REDACTED] machine, a [REDACTED] massager, an [REDACTED] machine,arch supports; and numerous pairs of costly shoes with arch support.

I am limited in what I am able to do each day due to injury and still not able to return to work. I can only wear two different pairs of shoes now and for only a few hours.

But to a greater or less degree there was discomfort ultimately in both legs.  I susbsequently sought medical attention. When I noticed an article about other people having problems with the shoes I stopped using them.    It took a long while to heal, but after I stopped wearing them the discomfort ultimately resolved and I had to come to the conclusion that it was the instability of the shoes that had caused my injury since this was the only variable which had changed in my routines or habits.',\n",

PLUS, it has taken me almost the all the nearly 5 yrs. since my fall to regain MOST of the strength, full use a flexibility I had in my right arm before - and I will probably NEVER be able to fully straighten it again and I STILL periodically experience throbbing pain and weakness in my right arm....\\r\\n    Although I like the shoes (for the most part) that Skechers USA puts out (and have bought 3 pairs of other, more \"conventional styles\"), I feel they have EGREGIOUSLY FAILED consumers such as myself who bought in to the promise of a \"more comfortable and enhanced\" way of obtaining the health benefits of walking, by not warning us of the possible instability this shoe design presents novice users.... \\r\\n    I paid a painful, heavy price for this FAILURE - NO ONE ELSE SHOULD...',\n",

       " u\"July 3, 2010, was filling up with gas at [REDACTED] in El Campo & stepped to put the hose back into holder when my left foot rolled over to the side.  I was wearing the Shape Ups from Sketchers.  My foot cracked in several places but it being a holiday weekend, there was nothing opened but the ER.  I hobbled around all weekend and went to the foot dr. in Houston on Monday.  X-Rays showed it was broken in 4 places.  I was placed in a boot for 9 months when it finally healed.  Almost a year later on July 10,2011, I was walking out of the house & as I stepped off the front step, my right foot did the same thing my left foot had done- it rolled over on it's side but it broke only two bones this time.  My doctor in Houston had moved and closed her office down when she left, so I went to another foot doctor in Bay City, Tx.  I wore a boot for 9 months but my foot would not heal so I had to have surgery & then would wear the boot for another 2 months.  I heard the infomercial about the Sketchers causing problems with feet so I filled out the appropriate forms and sent them in. I spent two years of my life wearing boots and hobbling up the stairs in our two story home instead of improve the appearance of my legs and body as the commercials for the shoes had advertised.  Not a very safe product for me to be wearing is all I deducted from all my medical expenses!\",\n",

       " u\"I bought these Sperry shoes at a boatshow and wore them for MAYBE 6-8 hours. The following morning at approximately 5am I was woken to burning and itching feet. The sensation was excruciating!! This was October 12th of 2015. The condition worsened even with taking Benadryl, using Benadryl spray and the liquid pen, soaking my feet in ice to lukewarm water, using tea tree oil and prescribed medication cream for rashes. Once the condition progressed, I went to the doctor October 15th where he stated it was a result of the chemical used to treat the leather on the shoe. I was advised to use a second prescribed cream. It is now the 16th of October, 2015, and the condition is at its worst. Swelling, fluid retention, Inflammation, itching, burning and pain have taken over a large area of both my feet from my toes to my heels. I can't sleep, I can't wear closed toe shoes, I can't focus with this pain and burn and itch constantly. I am going to the doctor again today. I am sickened that a company puts such harmful products into the market where unsuspecting consumers suffer without warning! I wasted my money on these shoes and now it's costing me even more with the worsening effects. I am definitely looking into filing with the Better Business Bureau as well as a potential lawsuit for the pain and suffering. This is disgusting! \"]"
