DataKind product working for the CPSC

Contents

* IPython notebook detailing process of parsing out products in the CPSC API data and matching it with NEISS
* Data folder contains
  * NEISS survey data: Link can be found [here](http://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/)
  * cleaned_api_data: sampled data pulled from the CPSC API, documentation is [here](http://saferproducts.gov/faq-developers.aspx)
* Project [hackpad](https://cpsc.hackpad.com/CPSC-DKDC-Collaboration-Public-bvTZPQLLvjD)

**CPSC asks**

1. Do certain types of products tend to be associated with more severe injuries?
2. Do certain types of products tend to affect different demographics differently?
  * Age?
  * Gender
  * Race (In NEISS - When provided it is reliable, but can't make population-wide estimates.  Some specific hospitals refuse to give race, so affects the weighting)
  * Locale? (Currently don't know where hospitals are.  If we did, could make assumptions about population mixes.  Hospitals supposed to be sampled to make nationwide estimates.)
  * Can anything else be derived?
3. Is there evidence of systematic under-reporting of injuries, based on type of injury, product, or demographic?
4. Is any of the above changing over time?
5. Is there a way to provide tools for CPSC to answer more location-specific question if only they can access that type of data?
6. Where should money be spent (e.g. both public awareness messaging and internally at CPSC)?
  * If goal is to maximize reduction of injuries?
  * If goal is to maximize reduction of injuries for under-served populations?
7. Any recommendations for CPSC's future state?  (e.g. additional data to collect or make available?)
